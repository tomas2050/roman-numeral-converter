There is no need to install anything extra as CDN is used to load the libraries.
## Run it locally

Run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/tomas2050/roman-numeral-converter.git
```

no server is set up, so a local web server(e.g. Web Server for Chorme) can be used to access the files.
